Steps to getting code running locally.
1. Clone this repo
2. Cd into the top level of this project
3. Run `npm install`
4. Compile static code from Angular2/TypeScript frontend code by running `npm run build`
5. Either serve that static however you please or navigate in your browser to `localhost:3000`

For frontend development:
This frontend application uses webpack for dependency mapping and serving.  Wepback has change detection, so code will
update as you edit the code.
